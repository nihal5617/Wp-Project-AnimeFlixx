              your account, you can use the &quot;Remember me on this
              device&quot; function when you log in to the website. This
              function uses technology that enables us to provide direct account
              access and to help administer the AnimeFlixx service without
              requiring reentry of any password or other user identification
              when your browser revisits the service.

              share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account,
              they will be able to see shows you have watched, ratings, account
              information (including your email address or other information in
              the &quot;Account&quot; area of our website), and game related
              information (such as your in-game name and saved game progress).
              This remains true even if you use our profiles feature. You might
              have the option to use seamless account login through the AnimeFlixx
              mobile app, which enables login to the AnimeFlixx app on smart TVs,
              set top boxes, and other streaming media devices on the Wi-Fi
              network to which you are connected. If you use that feature, those
              devices will remain signed into your account unless you later log
              out of those devices.

              <strong>Profiles:</strong> Profiles allow users to have a
              distinct, personalized AnimeFlixx experience, built around the movies
              and shows of interest to them, as well as separate watch
              histories. Please note that profiles are available to everyone who
              uses your AnimeFlixx account, so that anyone with access to your
              AnimeFlixx account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles.
              You should explain this to others with access to your account, and
              if you do not wish them to use or change your profile, be sure to
              let them know. Profile users may be offered the opportunity to add
              an email address, phone number or other information to the profile
              and will be provided with notice of collection and use at the time
              such information is requested (the Profile Privacy Notice applies

              To remove access to your AnimeFlixx account from your devices, visit
              the &quot;Account&quot; section of our website, choose &quot;Sign

          <strong>Push Notifications.</strong> You can choose to receive mobile
          push notifications from AnimeFlixx. On some device operating systems, you
          will be automatically enrolled in the notifications. If you
          subsequently decide you no longer wish to receive these notifications,
          you can use your mobile device&#x27;s settings functionality to turn

          <strong>Interest-Based Ads.</strong> Interest-based ads are online ads
          that are tailored to your likely interests based on your use of
          various apps and websites across the Internet. If you are using a
          browser, then cookies and web beacons can be used to collect
          information to help determine your likely interests. If you are using
          a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device that includes a
          resettable device identifier, then that identifier can be used to help
          determine your likely interests. For your choices about interest-based
          ads from AnimeFlixx, please see the &quot;Cookies and Internet
          Advertising&quot; section (below).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Matched Identifier Communications.</strong> Some third party
          sites and apps allow us to reach our users with online promotions
          about our titles and services by sending a privacy protective
          identifier to the third party. A privacy protective identifier means
          we convert the original information (such as an email address or phone
          number) into a value to keep the original information from being
          revealed. The third party compares the privacy protective identifier
          to identifiers in its database and there will be a match only if you
          have used the same identifier (such as an email address) with AnimeFlixx
          and the third party. If there is a match, AnimeFlixx can then choose
          whether or not to send a given promotional communication to you on
          that third party site or app, and can optimize and better measure the
          effectiveness of online advertising. You can opt out in the “Marketing
          Communications” section of the “Account” section of our website.{" "}

          We may reject requests that are unreasonable or not required by law,
          including those that would be extremely impractical, could require
          disproportionate technical effort, or could expose us to operational
          risks such as free trial fraud. We may retain information as required
          or permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honor
          your choices, for our billing or records purposes and to fulfill the
          purposes described in this Privacy Statement. We take reasonable
          measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a secure
          manner when it is no longer required.
        </p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
          We use reasonable administrative, logical, physical and managerial
          measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft
          and unauthorized access, use and modification. These measures are
          designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risks of
          processing your personal information.

        <h3>Other Websites, Platforms and Applications</h3>

          (such as voice controls) operated by third party platforms, or contain
          links to sites operated by third parties whose policies regarding the
          handling of information may differ from ours. For example, you may be
          able to access the AnimeFlixx service through platforms such as gaming
          systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, set top boxes and a number of
          other Internet connected devices. These websites and platforms have
          separate and independent privacy or data policies, privacy statements,
          notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. In
          addition, you may encounter third party applications that interact

        <h3>Changes to This Privacy Statement</h3>
        <p>
          We will update this Privacy Statement from time to time in response to
          changing legal, regulatory or operational requirements. We will
          provide notice of any such changes (including when they will take
          effect) in accordance with law. Your continued use of the AnimeFlixx
          service after any such updates take effect will constitute

          Statement, you may cancel your use of the AnimeFlixx service. To see when

          We and our Service Providers use cookies and other technologies (such
          as web beacons), as well as resettable device identifiers, for various
          reasons. We want you to be informed about our use of these
          technologies, so this section explains the types of technologies we
          use, what they do, and your choices regarding their use.

        <p>
          Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device
          when you browse and use websites and online services. We use other
          technologies such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5,
          IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may
          store small amounts of data on your device. Web beacons (also known as
          clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies. In
          many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web
          beacons associated with those cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use the AnimeFlixx app on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming
          media device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your
          device. Resettable device identifiers (also known as advertising
          identifiers) are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile
          devices and tablets (for example, the &quot;Identifier for
          Advertisers&quot; (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the &quot;Google
          Advertising ID&quot; on Android devices), and certain streaming media
          devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make
          online advertising more relevant and for analytics and optimization
          purposes.   
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why does AnimeFlixx use these technologies?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We use these types of technologies for various reasons, like making it
          easy to access our services by remembering you when you return; to
          provide, analyze, understand and enhance the use of our services; to
          enforce our terms, prevent fraud; to improve site performance, monitor
          visitor traffic and actions on our site; and to deliver and tailor our
          marketing or advertising, and to understand interactions with our
          emails, marketing, and online ads on third party sites.

              you previously provided (for example, during member sign up). We
              also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular

              These cookies and resettable device identifiers use information
              about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response
              to ads and emails, and to deliver ads that are more relevant to
              you and for analytics and optimization purposes. These types of
              ads are called &quot;interest-based advertising.&quot; The
              advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our
              Service Providers.

          In connection with our use of these technologies, some of the websites
          and apps where we advertise, as well as advertising technology
          companies that we use to purchase, deliver, optimize, and/or measure
          our advertisements (collectively “Advertising Partners”), may receive
          limited information from us as part of our campaign targeting,
          measurement, and optimization (e.g., steps completed in sign-up and
          site visit or app open/install information).
        </p>
        <p>
          Common uses of this type of information are to judge the effectiveness
          of and optimize ad campaigns, by allowing Advertising Partners to see
          when someone who saw an ad later signed up for our service.  Another
          common use is to make sure we do not serve ads trying to get
          individuals to sign up for the AnimeFlixx service if they are already a
          AnimeFlixx user.

        <p>
          AnimeFlixx uses contractual and technical measures designed to prevent
          Advertising Partners from accessing information regarding specific
          title selections you make, URLs you land on, or shows you have watched
          on our service. We do not share information about title selections or
          your shows you have watched on our service.

          To opt out of interest-based ads from AnimeFlixx in connection with a

          media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device
          (usually found under &quot;privacy&quot; or &quot;ads&quot; in your
          device&#x27;s settings). You may still see AnimeFlixx ads on your device,

          <strong>To exercise choice regarding other technologies</strong>

        <p>
          There are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding technologies
          that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins
          (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). For example, many popular
          browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the
          settings or preferences area; see your browser&#x27;s help function or
          support area to learn more. Other technologies, such as Silverlight
          storage, may be cleared from within the application.{" "}
